## Requirements

- **Hugo version 0.87.0 or higher**   
If you haven't installed Hugo, see [here](https://gohugo.io/installation/) for installation.


## Quick Start 


1. Create your site with Hugo.  
    This uses the `config.yaml` configuration file instead of the default TOML.   

    ```
    hugo new site my-site --format="yaml"
    ```
  

2. Clone this repository inside your themes folder:
    ```
    cd my-site/themes && git clone https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile.git
    ```
    This allows you to make lots of custom changes. However, if you wish to get automatic or structured updates from the original repo, you can add the theme as a submodule:

    ```
    cd my-site
    git init
    git submodule add https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile.git themes/hugo-profile
    ```    

3. Copy the example configuration file to your root directory:
    ```
    cp -f themes/hugo-profile/exampleSite/hugo.yaml ./hugo.yaml
    ```

4. Verify your site is on:
    ```
    hugo server
    ```


***Note:*** 

You may not see the images or the Blog/Gallery sections on the site initially, because their content currently resides in "themes/hugo-profile/exampleSite/", whereas Hugo expects them in the root-level `static/` (for images) and `content/` (for pages).

To have a complete view of the example site, simply run:    

```
rsync -av themes/hugo-profile/exampleSite/static/ ./static/
rsync -av themes/hugo-profile/exampleSite/content/ ./content/
```

You can customize or replace this content to match your own site.


## Content Management



For more details: [Hugo's official docs](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/), [content management](https://www.mikedane.com/static-site-generators/hugo/content-organization/)


Refer to our [wiki](https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile/wiki) for more details.




## Deployment

If you do not require extensive customization of website elements, the simplest way is to click the **Use this template** button to create your own repo, and connect that repo to Netlify. Whenever you make changes to the files inside the `exampleSite` folder, Netlify will automatically detect and deploy your changes. 


If you follow the steps in the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section above, you can still deploy your site to Netlify, but a few additional configurations are required. **See [here](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/) to host your site on Netlify**.


Alternatively, you can run `hugo` to generate the final, ready-to-deploy static output (i.e., the `public/` folder) and upload to the hosting platform. It is recommended to delete the `public/` folder before re-building to ensure it contains only the latest output:
```
rm -rf public/ && hugo
```


## Trouble-Shooting

```
ERROR error calling resources.GetRemote: Get "https://publish.twitter.com/oembed?dnt=false&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FGoHugoIO%2Fstatus%2F1315233626070503424": net/http: TLS handshake timeout
Built in 10266 ms
Error: error building site: logged 1 error(s)
```
The TLS handshake timeout error can happen due to network issues. If this error persists, you can delete the shortcode example `{{< tweet user="GoHugoIO" id="1315233626070503424" >}}` in the "content/blogs/rich-content.md" file.
